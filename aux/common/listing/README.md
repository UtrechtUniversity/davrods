HTML directory listing files
============================

Themed directory listings can be enabled with the vhost configuration
directives `DavrodsHtmlHead`, `DavrodsHtmlHeader` and
`DavrodsHtmlFooter`.

The HTML files in this directory are provided as an example
configuration for themed listings. Edit them before use.

We release these HTML files into the public domain.
