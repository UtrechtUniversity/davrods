## davrods-anonymous-vhost.conf
##
## Davrods is a mod_dav WebDAV provider. Configuration directives for
## Davrods should be placed in a <Location> block.
##
## Below we provide an example vhost configuration that enables Davrods
## in anonymous access mode. See the file 'davrods-vhost.conf' for a
## vhost configuration *with* authentication.
##
## Note that in order to use anonymous access, your iRODS permissions
## need to be set correctly as well:
## 1) Create the anonymous user if it doesn't yet exist (or use a
##    different user - see option DavrodsAnonymousLogin)
## 2) Grant read/write/own access to anonymous where appropriate
## 3) Point the DavrodsExposedRoot to a location where the anonymous
##    user has at least 'read' access.

#        # - davrods-locallock (recommended): WebDAV class 2 provider, uses a DBM lock database local to this webserver
#        #
#        # Note that the davrods-locallock provider requires an apache-writable lockdb directory
#        # (/var/lib/davrods, or a path specified using the DavrodsLockDB directive - see further down this file).

#        # - DavrodsHtmlHeader is inserted at the top of the listing's BODY tag.

#        #
#        # By default (value 'Off'), no such header is sent by Davrods.
#        # When DavrodsForceDownload is 'On', Davrods will send
